# SpaceX Falcon-9 Success Landing Prediction
## Predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully using a variety of machine learning models

### Project Description:

This project has as main objective to predict if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully or not.

The reuse of the first stage in launching a rocket makes its cost much more economical. In that work it was predicted whether the first stage of a SpaceX Falcon 9 Rocket would land successfully. 

Taking into account the savings that can be realized by reusing the first stage of a launched rocket and being able to determine whether the first stage will land successfully, it is feasible to determine the cost of a launch, allowing an alternative company to make an offer against SpaceX, which uses this strategy to make its launches cheaper.

Data science methodology was followed, going through data collection, data manipulation, exploratory data analysis, visualization and model development.
